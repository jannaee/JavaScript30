    //first: need to listen for the keyevent

    //so we can play the corresponding file

    window.addEventListener('keydown', function (e){
      //listen for key down and connect attribute to eventhandler
      //the keyevent objects are accessed from the keydown event 
      //note, i saw that you keyCode is deprecated and it was recommended that we use key which gives the key character. This allowed me to remove all of the data attributes from the HTML 
      //so i came up with another solution to not use the key mapping with codes but the key value 
      //Next We need to id if there is an element on the page that has a key to match the current key pushed in this event
      const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key='${e.key}']`);//the code in the slector is using an attribute selector, and since they key is a variable we wrapped in a template literals
      const key = document.querySelector(`.key[data-key='${e.key}']`);//this selector picks something with the class of key and a data attribute of the e.key
      if(!audio) return; //error handling. if the key doesn't have a value then don't do anything
      audio.currentTime = 0;//this method will allow the keypress to rewind to start essentially
      audio.play();//wow, really? there is a play method?! 
      key.classList.add('playing');
    });
      //use a transisition end event, or if it was transitioning, like how it was in the css classes .playing to .key
      function removeTransistion(e){//this does not refer to the removeTransition function, but where the function was called, or in the addEventListener. Additionally, this will refer to the 
        if(e.propertyName !== 'transform') return;
        //in other words skip it if it's not transform
        this.classList.remove('playing');
        console.log(this); //this is equal to the key because, this refers to the value of the function that called it. removeTransistion is not being called here

        });//when you have an array of elements you can't listen to each of them unless you loop over every single element
